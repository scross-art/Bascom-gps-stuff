Very much a work in progress. 

some basic GPS functions... 
Odometer with drift and stationanary ignore (wont add gps jitter to the total when not moving)
50+editable points of interest or waypoints stored in eeprom
qwerty on screen keyboard

still to add 'point in polygon' geo fence alarm and basic proximity alarms (anchor alarm)
and other stuff when I get around to it.



hardware is arduino mega2560 , encoder and switch for input, ssd1306, generic gps
